# Blood Transfusion Database Example  
  
This codebase consists of SQL schemas and example queries of few tables that provides simplified blood/donor/patient/hospital/transfusion procedure records management database system for CS (Computer Science) education purposes.

# Schema overview
<hr>


![[./readme/ERD.jpg]]



BloodDb schema consists of:
<ul>
	<li>6 tables</li>
	<li>1 historical table is generated by "MoveToOldtransfusions" procedure which  is outside schema file </li>
	<li>6 one to many relations</li>
	<li>1 many to many relations</li>
</ul>


# Tables and relations overview
<hr>

## Blood

![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117130135.png]]

![[./readme/blood.jpg]]

Table represents all possible combinations of antigens and D antibodies of human blood
ABO is the major blood group system and is genetically determined. ABO type depends on  A or B antigens on the red cells. If blood type is O,  cells don’t have either type of antigen.
D is the most important antigen of the Rh (Rhesus) system and it’s also known as RhD.

Blood Ids from this table are assigned to patients and donors.(one to many)

Fields:
<ul>
<li>id - autoincremented PK</li>
<li>type - blood ABO group </li>
<li>isRhesus - true/false value about RhD antigen </li>
<li>fullName - full name of blood type, combines values from "type" and "isRhesus" fields</li>

</ul>




### Blood_Blood

<hr>

![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117130206.png]]

![[./readme/blood_blood.jpg]]

Before transfusion, testing is done between the donated blood and patient to check for compatibility.
Table contains blood group compatibility table :


![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117131138.png]]

Table in schema is implemented as many to many relation between same table : "blood"
Technically "blood_blood" table looks like transfer table 

Fields
<ul>
<li>id - autoincremented PK</li>
<li>donorBloodID -  blood id from blood table  (many to many Foregin Key)</li>
<li>patientBloodID -   blood id from blood table (many to many Foregin Key)</li>
<li>isTransferable - stores true/false value with provides info about compatibility between donor and recipient blood </li>
</ul>




### Hospitals
<hr>


![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117130231.png]]

![[./readme/hospitals 1.jpg]]

This simple table stores all registered hospitals. All patients and Donors are assigned by one to many relation to the one of hospital. Transfusion table is also connected by the same relation.

Fields
<ul>
<li>id - autoincremented PK</li>
<li>address -  Hospital address</li>
<li>postcode-  Hospital postcode</li>
<li>name - full name of hospital</li>
<li>district -city district of hospital</li>
</ul>



### Patients
<hr>


![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117130240.png]]

![[./readme/patients.jpg]]


Stores data about patients. Table is related with transfusions, hospitals, blood table by one to many relation

Fields
<ul>
<li>id - autoincremented PK</li>
<li>address -  Patient address</li>
<li>postcode-  Patient postcode</li>
<li>surname - Patient surname</li>
<li>name - Patient name</li>
<li>bloodTypeID - assigned blood type id from blood table</li>
<li>recieviedBloodMl - int value of recievied blood in Ml (sum of blood from all transfusions)</li>
<li>telephone number - telephone number</li>
<li>neededBloodMl - float value of neededBlood in Ml ( field for future usage )</li>
<li>hospitalId - id of assigned hospital</li>
</ul>


### Donors
<hr>

Stores data about donors. Table is related with transfusions,hospitals, blood table by one to many relation


![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117130250.png]]

![[./readme/donors.jpg]]

Fields
<ul>
<li>id - autoincremented PK</li>
<li>address -  donor address</li>
<li>postcode-  donor postcode</li>
<li>surname - donor surname</li>
<li>name - donor name</li>
<li>bloodTypeID -  assigned blood type id from blood table</li>
<li>donatedBloodMl - int value of recievied blood in Ml (sum of blood from all transfusions)</li>
<li>telephone number - telephone number</li>
<li>neededBloodMl - float value of neededBlood in Ml ( field for future usage )</li>
<li>hospitalId - id of assigned hospital</li>
<li>isHonoraryDonor - true false value whitch determines if donor is honorary donor (donated blood is equal or higher than 3000 ml )</li>
</ul>




### Transfusions
<hr>

Holds records about transfusions between patients and donors in specific hospital (one to many ).


![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117130221.png]]

![[./readme/transfusions.jpg]]

<ul>
<li>id - autoincremented PK</li>
<li>patientID - id patient who recievied blood</li>
<li>donorID - id donor who donated blood</li>
<li>hospitalId - id of hospital where transfusion had been done</li>
<li>date - date of transfusion in ' YYYY-MM-DD ' format</li>
<li>telephone number - telephone number</li>
<li>bloodTransferedMl - float value of transfered blood during transfusion in Ml</li>
</ul>

By using procedure "MoveToOldtransfusions" as CRON job (executes commands at specific dates and times) transfusion table can behave like a temporary table with the newest records (for ex. recent month). Older transfusions would be stored in old_transfusions table.

All mentioned relations with foregin keys are defined below

# Mock data  generation steps
<hr>

Dataset was generated using a <a href=" https://www.mockaroo.com/">Mockaroo</a> online random data generator

![[./readme/Pasted image 20220117142103.png]]

It can export generated data to CSV, SQL format.
Some tables like "transfusions" needed to be verified for example in terms of blood type compatibility. Also transferred blood and 
"honorary donor" value must be related with data from other tables. It was accomplished by using some alter or delete and some "utility" queries on live database.

Utility Queries (Delete, Update) used to generate consistent dataset :
